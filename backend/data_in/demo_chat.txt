[15.01.25, 08:15:23] Emma: Good morning! ☀️
[15.01.25, 08:16:45] James: Morning! How did you sleep?
[15.01.25, 08:17:12] Emma: Pretty good actually. Had the weirdest dream though
[15.01.25, 08:17:30] James: Tell me!
[15.01.25, 08:18:55] Emma: We were in a library but all the books were made of cheese 😂
[15.01.25, 08:19:20] James: That's amazing hahaha
[15.01.25, 08:20:01] Emma: I know right! And you were there trying to read them very seriously
[15.01.25, 08:21:15] James: Of course I was. Knowledge is power, even when it's dairy-based
[15.01.25, 09:30:42] Emma: BTW are we still on for dinner tonight?
[15.01.25, 09:31:10] James: Yes! I booked that Italian place you mentioned
[15.01.25, 09:31:45] Emma: Perfect! 7pm?
[15.01.25, 09:32:00] James: 7pm works 👍
[15.01.25, 14:22:18] James: Meeting running late, might be 15 min delayed
[15.01.25, 14:23:05] Emma: No worries, take your time
[15.01.25, 19:47:33] Emma: That was such a good meal!
[15.01.25, 19:48:12] James: The tiramisu was incredible
[15.01.25, 19:48:40] Emma: I can't believe you ordered THREE desserts
[15.01.25, 19:49:15] James: No regrets. Life's too short for small portions 😋
[15.01.25, 19:50:02] Emma: This is why I like you
[15.01.25, 22:15:44] James: Home safe. Thanks for a lovely evening ❤️
[15.01.25, 22:16:20] Emma: Thank you for dinner! Sleep well 💙

[16.01.25, 08:00:55] James: Great, I'm at the usual place
[16.01.25, 08:15:22] Emma: On my way!
[16.01.25, 11:30:48] James: Did you see the email from work?
[16.01.25, 11:31:20] Emma: Yeah... not thrilled about the deadline
[16.01.25, 11:31:55] James: Want to work on it together this weekend?
[16.01.25, 11:32:30] Emma: That would actually help a lot
[16.01.25, 11:33:10] James: Cool, Saturday afternoon?
[16.01.25, 11:33:45] Emma: Perfect. My place?
[16.01.25, 11:34:00] James: Works for me 👍
[16.01.25, 18:22:15] Emma: Just remembered - it's your mom's birthday next week right?
[16.01.25, 18:23:40] James: Oh crap yes! Thanks for reminding me
[16.01.25, 18:24:15] Emma: I saw a beautiful scarf at that shop we went to last month
[16.01.25, 18:25:02] James: You're the best! Can we go check it out tomorrow?
[16.01.25, 18:25:30] Emma: Of course! I'll be there around 2
[17.01.25, 10:12:33] James: Look what I found!

[17.01.25, 10:18:05] Emma: Somewhere with mountains? You mentioned wanting to go hiking
[17.01.25, 10:19:15] James: Switzerland? Austria?
[17.01.25, 10:19:50] Emma: Let's look at options this weekend
[17.01.25, 10:20:15] James: Deal! I'm excited already
[17.01.25, 15:45:28] Emma: Random question
[17.01.25, 15:45:40] James: Shoot
[17.01.25, 15:46:12] Emma: If you could have any superpower what would it be?
[17.01.25, 15:47:05] James: Hmm... teleportation maybe? Would save so much commute time
[17.01.25, 15:47:40] Emma: That's so practical 😂
[17.01.25, 15:48:15] James: What's yours?
[17.01.25, 15:49:02] Emma: Time manipulation. Could get so much more done
[17.01.25, 15:49:35] James: Also very practical! We're so boring haha
[17.01.25, 15:50:10] Emma: Or just very efficient 😎
[17.01.25, 21:30:44] James: You awake?
[17.01.25, 21:31:15] Emma: Yeah, watching something. What's up?
[17.01.25, 21:32:20] James: Nothing really. Just wanted to say I appreciate you
[17.01.25, 21:33:05] Emma: That's sweet ❤️ Where's this coming from?
[17.01.25, 21:34:15] James: I don't know. Just been thinking today how lucky I am to have you in my life
[17.01.25, 21:35:22] Emma: You're going to make me cry! I feel the same way about you
[17.01.25, 21:36:10] James: Good tears I hope? 😊
[17.01.25, 21:36:45] Emma: The best tears. You're really special to me
[17.01.25, 21:37:30] James: You too. Always ❤️
[18.01.25, 08:00:15] Emma: Morning!
[18.01.25, 08:00:42] James: Hey! Ready for Saturday?
[18.01.25, 08:01:20] Emma: Yeah! Picked up some good coffee for our work session

[18.01.25, 12:16:10] Emma: For Saturday? Thai!
[18.01.25, 12:16:45] James: Great minds think alike. I was hoping you'd say that
[18.01.25, 12:17:20] Emma: You already ordered didn't you 😂

[19.01.25, 16:32:20] Emma: Really? Are you sure?
[19.01.25, 16:33:05] James: Absolutely. Mom keeps asking about you anyway
[19.01.25, 16:33:50] Emma: Okay! I'd love to come ❤️
[19.01.25, 16:34:25] James: Perfect. Fair warning though - my dad will tell his terrible jokes
[19.01.25, 16:35:10] Emma: I love terrible dad jokes!
[19.01.25, 16:35:45] James: You're going to fit right in 😂
